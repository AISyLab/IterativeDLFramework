# IterativeDLFramework
This repository provides the source code to reproduce results from paper "Keep it unsupervised: Horizontal Attacks meet Deep Learning" that is accepted on TCHES2021, issue 1. 

# Datasets

The datasets to be used with this framework must be downloaded from the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/e2mlegb71qp4em3/ecc_datasets.zip?dl=0
The file ecc_datasets.zip contain two ECC datasets. Each dataset contain 76500 traces, each one of them representing a sub-trace in a scalar multiplication. In total, each dataset contains 300 255-bit scalar multiplications. Each scalar multiplication contain a randomized 255-bit scalar.
